Welcome to the Computer Vision in Advertising and Marketing (CVAM) workshop at ICCV 2025! We're delighted to have you join us here in Honolulu, Hawaii for this exciting exploration of cutting-edge computer vision applications in digital advertising and marketing.

This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss how computer vision is transforming the way brands connect with audiences through visual content. Throughout the day, we'll explore fundamental visual understanding tasks, marketing optimization systems, brand intelligence, responsible AI practices, creative generation techniques, and emerging technologies.

Our program covers six key topic areas:

**Multimodal Data Understanding**: Visual content understanding, video scene analysis, multi-modal content processing, and visual similarity and retrieval.

**Marketing and Optimization**: Real-time bidding optimization, dynamic creative optimization (DCO), conversion rate prediction, performance forecasting, A/B testing for visuals, and resource-light video and image analysis.

**Brand Intelligence**: Brand safety, visual brand consistency, logo/product detection, sentiment analysis, cross-platform tracking, and brand suitability.

**Responsible AI and Privacy**: Privacy-preserving visual analytics, bias mitigation, transparency, ethical considerations in advertising, live-streaming CTV content and brand safety, and user privacy protection.

**Creative Generation and Enhancement**: Generative AI for ad creation, style transfer, automated visual optimization, and personalized content generation.

**Emerging Technologies**: The latest innovations shaping the future of visual advertising and marketing.

We look forward to inspiring presentations, engaging discussions, and valuable networking opportunities throughout the day. Thank you for being here, and let's make this a memorable and productive workshop!
