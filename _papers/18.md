abstract: "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in influencer marketing has transformed the industry, offering enhanced efficiency and scalability while raising critical concerns about authenticity, transparency, and consumer trust preservation. This survey examines current approaches to human-AI collaboration in influencer marketing, analyzing how brands can leverage AI-powered content generation while maintaining the credibility and transparent relationships that drive consumer engagement.

Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature on influencer credibility, disclosure practices, and consumer trust mechanisms, we present a taxonomy of authenticity preserving content generation methods. Our findings reveal that strategic AI-human collaboration must navigate complex consumer persuasion knowledge, advertising literacy, and skepticism while maintaining the transparency and source credibility that underpin successful influencer marketing.

Key approaches include disclosure-aware content creation, credibility-preserving collaboration workflows, and trust-building mechanisms that acknowledge consumer sophistication in detecting commercial intent. We identify critical challenges including the need for appropriate disclosure of AI assistance, maintaining para-social relationships in technology-mediated content creation, and balancing efficiency gains with credibility preservation. As consumer advertising literacy continues to evolve, this survey offers a comprehensive foundation for navigating the balance between technological innovation and the transparency, credibility, and authentic engagement that drive sustainable influencer marketing success."
