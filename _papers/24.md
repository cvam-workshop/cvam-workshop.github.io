abstract: "We introduce a new framework with three metrics, Creativity, Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP), for evaluating advertisement image generation. Current Text-to-Image (T2I) methods excel with explicit descriptions but struggle with generating creative and persuasive images from implicit prompts. We highlight these weaknesses and present a simple yet effective approach to enhance the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images."
