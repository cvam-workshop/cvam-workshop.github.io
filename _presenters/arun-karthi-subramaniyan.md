Dr. Arun Karthi Subramaniyan is the Founder & CEO of Articul8. Previously, he led
the Cloud & AI Strategy team at Intel where he was responsible for establishing
and driving the overall AI strategy globally and was focused on democratizing AI in
a sustainable fashion. Arun joined Intel from Amazon Web Services (AWS), where
he led the Extreme-scale computing team spanning Machine Learning, Quantum
Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), Autonomous Vehicles, and
Autonomous Computing. His team was responsible for developing solutions across
all areas of HPC, quantum computing and large-scale machine learning
applications, spanning a $1B+ portfolio, and he grew the businesses 2-3x over two
years. Arun’s primary areas of research focus are Bayesian methods, global
optimization, probabilistic deep learning for large scale applications, and
distributed computing.

He enjoys working at the intersection of massively parallel computing and modeling
large-scale systems. Before AWS, Arun founded and led the AI products team at
GE’s Oil & Gas division, and grew the digital products business successfully. He and
his team developed deep learning-augmented hybrid analytics for all segments of
the oil & gas industry. Arun led the development of the Digital Twin platform for GE
at GE’s Global Research Center. The platform continues to enable several thousand
engineers to build advanced models efficiently. The asset specific cumulative
damage modeling techniques he and his team pioneered define the standard for
industrial damage modeling. As a Six Sigma Master Black Belt, he developed
advanced techniques and tools for efficiently modeling large scale systems like jet
engine fleets, gas turbines in powerplants and accelerated design times by 3-4X.
Arun is a prolific researcher with a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue
University with 34 granted patents (54 filed), 50+ international publications that
have been cited more than 1600 times with a h-index of 16. He is also a recipient
of the Hull Award from GE, which honors technologists for their outstanding
technical impact.
