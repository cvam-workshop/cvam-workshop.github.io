I am an Executive level, Machine Learning / Computer Vision expert with a passion to bridge technology and business. In 2020, I co-established Bria with the vision to create a responsible and open platform for visual generative AI. Bria is pioneering responsible Generative AI, aiming to democratize this technology for enhancing products and setting new industry benchmarks.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science in the field of computer vision from Ben-Gurion University with collaboration with Harvard University.

I served as the CTO of Trax Retail, where I took part in Trax rapid growth from early stage startup with 20 employees to a Unicorn with over 850 employees. I was/am involved in several companies as an advisory board including Sparx, Vicomi, Tasq, DataGen and Anima.
