As a technologist and a manager, I lead visual algorithms research at Intel Labs. We are looking into research problems such as video analysis and generation; efficient long-form structured and multimodal learning without hitting the memory / compute bottleneck.

My additional responsibilities include overseeing Intel's global AI academic investment portfolio. We do collaborate with like-minded researchers from academia and industry!
