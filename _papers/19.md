abstract: "Document image retrieval is crucial for document understanding. Unlike standard text-to-image tasks that align captions with natural images, it requires interpreting user questions and retrieving relevant tables or scientific figures. Domain gaps between captions and queries, as well as natural and scientific images, make existing retrieval models ineffective. To study this, we introduce DocQIR, a multilingual benchmark covering 5 languages. Our study shows that off-the-shelf models fail when queries are multilingual. To address this, we propose DocQIR-Emb, which uses a multilingual text encoder and a VLM to map questions and images into a shared space. The text encoder is frozen, while the VLM is optimized. Experiments show DocQIR-Emb improves retrieval by over 40% across both tables and scientific images."
