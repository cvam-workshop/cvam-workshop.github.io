abstract: "Ad avoidance behavior is an increasingly important problem for social platforms that rely on permission advertising revenues. A common tactic employed by platforms is to impose a period of forced ad exposure. For example, YouTube typically requires viewers to watch the first five seconds of an ad, after which the viewer can choose to skip the ad and proceed to the desired content. In this paper, we develop a model that quantifies the effects of forced ad exposure on consumers' emotions and ad-skipping behavior when watching online video advertisements. We use artificial empathy (i.e., facial recognition technology) to measure emotions in a way that is completely unobtrusive, thus avoiding mere measurement effects. Leveraging computer vision techniques, we also extract frame-level features from video advertisements. Our Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model captures the temporal trajectory of consumer emotions under forced and unforced ad exposure conditions as well as the dynamics of the consumer's ad skipping behavior. Our results indicate that forced ad exposure largely ignites contempt and disgust and suppresses feelings of surprise. Surprise and anger cause a decrease in skipping probability while contempt, disgust, and sadness increase the risk of losing the audience's attention. Moreover, we find a high carryover effect in the skipping propensity, which highlights the importance of capturing viewers' attention in the opening seconds. These findings offer actionable insights for ad designers and platforms, especially in the era of generative AI and personalized video content."
