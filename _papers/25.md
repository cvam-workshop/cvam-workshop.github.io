abstract: "Text-to-image models are appealing for customizing visual advertisements and targeting specific populations. We investigate this potential by examining the demographic bias within ads for different ad topics, and the disparate level of persuasiveness (judged by models) of ads that are identical except for the gender/race of the people portrayed. We also experiment with a technique to target ads for specific countries."
