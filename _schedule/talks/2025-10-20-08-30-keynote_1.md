title: Beyond the Arena - Building Text-to-Image Models That Work for Brands
track: null
---

This talk will address how to train text-to-image models so they are truly useful for real-world marketing and advertising applications, rather than just demos. I will explain why arena-style evaluations are fundamentally flawed, and propose alternative training and evaluation approaches that prioritize robustness, brand consistency, controllability, and integration into creative workflowsâ€”turning models into practical tools for enterprise campaigns.
