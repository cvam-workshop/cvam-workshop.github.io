abstract: "Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation. It demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that combines OCR, inpainting, MT, and reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six language locales demonstrate that the proposed approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements suitable for real-world applications"
