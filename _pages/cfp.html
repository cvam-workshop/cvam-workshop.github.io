    <h3>🌟 Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The CVAM workshop aims to bridge the gap between academic research and industry needs in the rapidly evolving advertising and marketing sector.
      With over $600B in annual spend, advertising remains a visually rich domain that is still underrepresented in the computer vision research community.
      From brand safety and contextual targeting to creative generation and performance forecasting, CVAM will explore how modern computer vision and generative AI can drive innovation across the advertising value chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We invite high-quality paper submissions addressing novel research, systems, and applications at the intersection of <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>marketing optimization</strong>, and <strong>advertising technology</strong>.
