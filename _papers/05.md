abstract: "This paper introduces Confidence-Ranked Reasoning, a novel approach for multi-label classification using large language models (LLMs) that balances reasoning capabilities with computational efficiency. Our approach addresses token constraints by instructing the model to rank categories by confidence, then performing detailed reasoning only for the top-k candidates. Evaluating on a customer service dialog dataset with 65 categories, we demonstrate that our method with k=5 achieves a 13% improvement in micro F1 score over standard Chain-of-Thought prompting while using 32% fewer tokens. The approach effectively focuses reasoning resources on promising categories, with optimal efficiency around k=5. Our method enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning traces and provides controllable trade-offs between thoroughness and efficiency, representing a practical advancement for multi-label classification with LLMs."
