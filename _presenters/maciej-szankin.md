With over 30 peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals and international conferences, I specialize in areas such as multi-objective optimization, generative AI, distributed machine learning, model compression and neural architecture search. I hold a MSc in Computer Science and I am currently a PhD candidate, focusing on efficient neural network architectures for real-time image and signal processing on resource-constrained devices and ML accelerators.
