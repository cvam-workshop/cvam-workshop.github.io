title: Beyond Content - Building Trust and Precision with Domain-Specific GenAI
track: null
---

As marketing and advertising teams adopt AI at scale, the challenge is no longer generating content: it is ensuring that content is trusted, precise, and contextually accurate. General-purpose models often fall short in high-stakes industries, where nuance, compliance, and credibility matter most. This keynote will showcase how Articul8 is advancing domain-specific models (DSMs) trained on industry-grade data and expertise, paired with specialized agents such as LLM-IQ for model evaluation and ModelMeshâ„¢, an agent-of-agents reasoning engine that dynamically selects the right models and agents for each task.

We will share evidence of how DSMs consistently outperform general models in reasoning and efficiency. We will demonstrate how grounding AI in domain expertise enables scalable systems built on transparency and trust. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of why hyper-personalization with DSMs defines the next frontier in AI for marketing and how leaders can harness this shift to stay ahead.
