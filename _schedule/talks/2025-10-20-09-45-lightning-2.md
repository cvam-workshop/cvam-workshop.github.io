This lightning talk highlights the evolution of computer vision in the intellectual property space, drawing from Sandra Mauâ€™s work at Clarivate and her former startup, TrademarkVision. Discover how image-based search and AI-driven classification are transforming the way trademarks, designs, and patents are managed and protected in industry and by governments globally. From pioneering one of the first commercial SaaS image search engines to scaling global IP solutions, Sandra shares insights into the technical challenges, breakthroughs, and real-world impact of visual search in IP data.
