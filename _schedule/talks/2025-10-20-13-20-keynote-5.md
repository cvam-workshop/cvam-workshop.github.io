Generative AI is transforming advertising and marketing by enabling the creation of multimodal content like images, video, and text that feels more tailored and engaging than ever before. However, these creative advances raise important questions about privacy, security, transparency, and fairness. This talk will explore how responsible AI practices, including approaches such as federated learning and differential privacy, can support personalization in advertising without compromising user trust.
