title: Steering Generative Video Models Toward Product Fidelity in Advertising
track: null
---

Generative image and video models are rapidly entering ad-creative workflows, turning briefs into assets at scale. Yet product fidelity—accurate geometry, textures, colors, logos, and on-pack text—remains non-negotiable for customer trust, brand/legal compliance, and credible measurement.
In this talk, I’ll outline a few fidelity-first approaches for steering generative video models toward product-faithful ad creative. I’ll discuss product-aware generation conditioned on a reference product, a model-agnostic post-restoration module that repairs drift from reference image(s), and a supervisory agent that automatically clips or discards distorted shots and, when needed, revises prompts or switches base models.
