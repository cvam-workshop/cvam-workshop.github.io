I am a research scientist at Intel Labs, working on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, especially on video and multi-modal contextual learning. I received my Ph.D. from University of California San Diego (UCSD), advised by Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos in the Statistical Visual Computing Lab. My research focused on long-tail recognition with realistic and evolving models, aiming to generate reliable predictions and adapt to continually changing distributions. Before coming to UCSD, I received my B.S. and M.S. from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), where I worked with Prof. Min Sun on multi-modal video-sensor fusion in the Vision Science Lab. Please refer to my CV for more details.
