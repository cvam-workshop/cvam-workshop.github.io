abstract: "Visual Text Stylization and Synthesis aims to generate a text that has the same style as the input text. This task is more challenging if the input and output images are of different languages, and remains an unaddressed issue for the state-of-the-art diffusion-based image generation models. To fulfill the demand for cross-lingual visual text stylization and synthesis for commercial applications, we propose a hybrid approach combining the strengths of two different methods: text rendering and diffusion models to generate visual text with the same style as the reference visual text image. This approach addresses the technical challenges of cross-lingual text style transfer and is able to produce high quality visual text with various styles and complex texture. Moreover, our approach is able to handle long text with multi-line layout by incorporating large language models (LLM). We evaluate our approach on a large test set of bilingual visual text pairs. It is shown in the experiments that the proposed approach outperforms strong baselines and is comparable to human-created ones, according to human perception."
